to do:
- test that unicode() doesn't break things where there was str()
- test that this does what it's supposed to, maybe replace with dummy actions
- create a branch where the order of file overwrites and all matches 100%
- have to update filenames for "list.txt" and "done.txt" in other *.py
- verify that set() is okay for subscribers/processed message ids
  was formerly list(). do they want to keep track of the order?
  - pull out common functionality into shared .py file, so each .py is more
    terse
    - add documentation for everything
    - submit pull request
    - potentially request and test with actual bot/data
